# SOAR-BTHS_Visualization-Calorimetry
The SOAR Calorimetry Visualization was developed as part of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering's [Science Outeach and Research Program (SOAR)](https://wp.nyu.edu/tandonschoolofengineering-soar/about/)

The lab visualizes the steps of a high school level calorimetry chemistry lab, with the goal of familiarizing students with the lab procedure prior to their time in the lab.
